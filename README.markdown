# About

Heman is an application health monitoring system for application-level health.

# Goals

 * Provide short-term (1 hour, 3 hour, 12 hour, 24 hour, 48 hour) views of application specific usage.
 * Allow developers to create 'rules' that help discern overall application health.
 * Create a clean, easy to read interface to describe application health.
