# Data Structures

There are four data structures.

## Rules

The rules define the stats that are used and how they are processed.

## Stats

The stats are collected and aggregated.

## Health

The health rules are used to create a health score for a given namespace.

## Log

The log keeps a record of a health score at a period of time and describes why.

# Web View

The root page shows a total view of all of the namespaces the app is tracking health for.

# Namespace view

The namespace view shows the details of a specific namespace.

# Namespace admin

The namespace admin page is used to change the rules and health of a given namespace.
